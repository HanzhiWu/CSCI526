# Description
## Logline
Our game is a 2D platformer game in which the player’s size shrinks as time passes.
## Prototype Description
  Our prototype is a platformer game where the player navigates through levels while constantly shrinking in size. The player can control their body size to overcome obstacles and find the key to complete the level. Our enemies include laser guns and pools of venom. We also provide power-ups that either restore the player's size or halt the shrinking process. If the player dies, they will respawn at the most recent checkpoint. The winning condition for the game is to collect a level-completing key, while the losing condition is shrinking down to zero size three or more times.
	We adapted the “diminishing” and “freeze” theme in our game as a design for the 
player’s changes in size: the player’s size is “diminishing” all the time except for the cases when it collects the power-up that helps it with “freezing” its size.
